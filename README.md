# IconFontToDatabase
To better access individual glyphs from Icon Fonts across different Font types

Given that I have many Font files for Icons, searching for one in particular is a real waste of time,
thus with this program the user can TAG the glyphs in a Font file, a .CSV is generated along the way 
containing the fields:

- ''   (empty intended for use later with AutoKeying in MySQL)
- glyph
- FontName
- glyph DECIMAL value
- Description

How to use:
- Modify line 13 to the file.csv you want to use
- Modify line 13 to the FontFile.ttf you want to create tags for 
- Start the program......
- The program shows the first Glyph from the font, just write descriptive words for it and click the only 
button to save it to the .CSV

- Repeat last step over and over until you finished with all the Glyps.
